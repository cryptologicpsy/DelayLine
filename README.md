The DelayLine Plugin is a versatile audio effect plugin created using the JUCE framework. It employs a circular buffer to implement delay effects, offering musicians and sound producers flexibility and adaptability in shaping their soundscapes.

Key Features
Circular Buffer: The plugin utilizes a circular buffer to store and playback audio signals with delay.

Adjustable Delay Time: Users can customize the delay time to achieve various effects, such as modulation, ping-pong delay, and more.

Feedback Control: The feedback parameter lets you control the amount of feedback in the delayed signal.

Mix Control: The mix parameter allows you to blend the dry and wet signals for precise sound shaping.

Smooth Value: The plugin includes a "smooth value" feature for achieving smooth transitions between different delay settings.

Usage
To use the DelayLine Plugin with Circular Buffer, follow these steps:

Download the code from our GitHub repository.

Install the JUCE framework and any necessary dependencies if you haven't already.

Open the plugin code in JUCE and adjust the circular buffer, delay time, feedback, mix, and other parameters as needed.

Build the plugin and integrate it into your application or Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).

Use the plugin in your audio projects to add delay effects with the circular buffer.

Upcoming Features
In the future, we plan to introduce additional functionalities, including:

Stereo Ping-Pong Delay: A stereo ping-pong delay effect for creating wide and immersive spatial audio.

Filter Options: Integration of filter options to shape the delayed signal's frequency content.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): A user-friendly GUI for intuitive parameter control and visual feedback.

Stay tuned for these exciting enhancements to further elevate your sound design possibilities.
